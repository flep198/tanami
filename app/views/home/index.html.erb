      <h1>TANAMI</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">TANAMI (Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Austral Milliarcsecond Interferometry) is a multiwavelength program to monitor relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN) of the Southern Sky. TANAMI consists of 1) a VLBI core program targeting the parsec-scale structures of blazars, radio galaxies and other types of AGN, 2) complementary radio spectral and light-curve monitoring programs with ATCA and the Ceduna telescope, and 3) higher-energy multiwavelength observations with REM, Swift, XMM-Newton, Suzaku, INTEGRAL, Fermi/LAT and other telescopes. Currently, TANAMI is monitoring about 135 jets at different cadences based on their known variability timescale. Though a significant fraction of these were originally not known to be gamma-ray sources, the vast majority have now been detected by Fermi in the gamma-ray band.</h5>
